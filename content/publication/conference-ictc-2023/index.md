abstract: Mobility management is a critical aspect of cellular network operations, and paging is an essential procedure of this process. The emergence of 5G and beyond networks serving huge number of mobile users/devices requiring strict QoS-required, heterogeneous, has increased the complexity of mobility management. An highly efficient paging procedure demands the fast response of mobile usersâ€™ location information in the minimal expense of network resources. The investigation of data collected from the mobile network operation has posed that the variation of wireless communication has high impact on the efficiency of the paging procedure. An improvement to paging procedure has been proposed and evaluated with the data collected from a real-world operated mobile network. The results have shown that the number of radio base station joining in the paging procedure can be reduced up to about 95% with the conservation of the required paging success ratio, over 95%.

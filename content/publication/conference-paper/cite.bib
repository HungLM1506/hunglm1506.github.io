abstract="Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction helped endoscopy doctors analyze the patients' gastrointestinal surfaces and abnormality detections. In this work, we expand this development further with a reconstruction method based on both classic techniques like structure from motion and recent advanced techniques like neural radiation fields and Gaussian splatting with new Gaussian encoding-decoding modules. In addition, an unique dataset was collected with some videos from daily endoscopy examinations. This development helped us achieve better reconstruction results and lower training time compared to existing methods.",
